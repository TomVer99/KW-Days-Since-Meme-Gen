# KW Days Since Meme Gen

This program came to be due to people excessively asking about the release data of the Kiowa Warrior for DCS in the Polychop discord. Eventually a meme was made about this by someone else. But updating the image each time in PhotoShop was a pain. So I made this program to automate the process.

## Requirements

- (Tested on) Python 3.10
  - PIL library
- A sense of humor

## Usage

Simply execute `main.py`. The program will do the rest.
