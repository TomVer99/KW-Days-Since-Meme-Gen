# KW Days Since Meme Gen

This program came to be due to people excessively asking about the release data of the Kiowa Warrior for DCS in the Polychop discord. Eventually a meme was made about this by someone else. But updating the image each time in PhotoShop was a pain. So I made this program to automate the process.

## Requirements

- (Tested on) Python 3.10
  - PIL library
- A sense of humor

## Usage

Simply execute `main.py`. The program will do the rest.

## Updating the save file

In case your save file gets out of date, you can manually update it.
The save file is located in the same directory as `main.py` and is called `save.txt`.
The format is as follows:

```text
<year>-<month>-<day>
<record days>
```

Example:

```text
2023-07-18
12
``````
